## **Music Store Analysis Project** ðŸŽµ  
This project demonstrates SQL proficiency through a series of analytical questions designed to extract meaningful insights from a hypothetical music store database.  

---
### **Project Overview**  
The objective of this project is to analyze the operations of a music store by performing data queries that tackle real-world business questions. The dataset includes information about employees, invoices, tracks, albums, customers, and more. 

### **Objectives**
- Identifying senior employees based on job title.  
- Analyzing invoice data by country.  
- Extracting top invoice values, etc.  

### **Scenarios and Insights**  
This project is divided into three sections based on question difficulty:  

#### **Easy Section**  
1. Identify the most senior employee based on job title.  
2. Determine which countries generate the most invoices.  
3. Discover the top 3 invoice amounts.  

#### **Intermediate Section**  
1. Calculate the total revenue generated by each sales agent.  
2. Find out which customers purchased the most tracks.  
3. Analyze the most popular genres by sales volume.  

#### **Advanced Section**  
1. Determine which albums are the most profitable.  
2. Analyze the trend of monthly sales.  
3. Identify correlations between track lengths and popularity.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Database**: SQL-based relational database system.  
- **Queries**: Structured Query Language (SQL).  
- **Visualization**: Potential to integrate with tools like Power BI or Tableau (optional).  

### **How to Use**  
1. Clone the repository to access SQL scripts.  
2. Use a SQL-compatible database tool (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) to run the queries.  
3. Review the provided results to understand business insights.  

### **SQL Queries**  
The queries for each section are documented and organized in the SQL file for ease of use.
