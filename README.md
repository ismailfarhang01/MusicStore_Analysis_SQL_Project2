## **Music Store Analysis Project** ðŸŽµ  

## Project Overview
**Project Title**: Music Store Analysis Project  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `Music_SQL_Project`

This project demonstrates SQL proficiency through a series of analytical questions designed to extract meaningful insights from a hypothetical music store database.  

---
### **Objectives**
The objective of this project is to analyze the operations of a music store by performing data queries that tackle real-world business questions which has 3 types (Easy, Moderate, Advace). The dataset includes information about employees, invoices, tracks, albums, customers, and more. 

### **Scenarios and Insights**  
This project is divided into three sections based on question difficulty:  

#### **Easy Section**  
1. Identify the most senior employee based on job title.  
2. Determine which countries generate the most invoices.  
3. Discover the top 3 invoice amounts.

```sql
--Q1. Who is the most senior employee based on job title?
    SELECT first_name, last_name, title, levels
    FROM employee
    ORDER BY levels DESC
    LIMIT 1;

--Q2. Which countries have the most invoices?
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt_invoices, billing_country
    FROM invoice
    GROUP BY billing_country
    ORDER BY cnt_invoices DESC;

--Q3. What are the top 3 values of total invoices?
    SELECT total
    FROM invoice
    ORDER BY total DESC
    LIMIT 3;

--Q4. Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional music festival in the city
-- We made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that has the highest sum of invoice totals.
-- Return both the city name and sum of all invoice totals.
    SELECT billing_city, SUM(total) as high_total_invoices
    FROM invoice
    GROUP BY billing_city
    ORDER BY high_total_invoices
    LIMIT 1;

--Q5. Who are the top 5 best customers? The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customers.
-- Write a query that returns people who have spent the most money.
    SELECT c.customer_id, concat(c.first_name, c.last_name) as full_name, SUM(i.total) as total_spent
    FROM customer c
    JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id
    ORDER BY total_spent DESC
    LIMIT 5;
```

#### **Intermediate Section**  
1. Calculate the total revenue generated by each sales agent.  
2. Find out which customers purchased the most tracks.  
3. Analyze the most popular genres by sales volume.
   
```sql
--Q1. Write query to return the email, first name, last name and genre of all rock music listeners.
-- Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.
    SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(first_name, last_name) as full_name, email
    FROM customer c
    JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
    JOIN invoice_line il ON i.invoice_id = il.invoice_id
    WHERE track_id IN(
    	SELECT track_id FROM track
    	JOIN genre g ON track.genre_id = g.genre_id
    	WHERE g.name LIKE 'Rock'
    )
    ORDER BY email;

--Q2. Let's invite the artists who have written in the most rock music in our dataset.
-- Write query that returns the artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.
    SELECT a.name, COUNT(track_id) as cnt_total_rock
    FROM track
    JOIN album alb ON track.album_id = alb.album_id
    JOIN artist a ON a.artist_id = alb.artist_id
    JOIN genre g ON track.genre_id = g.genre_id
    WHERE g.name LIKE 'Rock'
    GROUP BY a.name
    ORDER BY cnt_total_rock DESC
    LIMIT 10;

--Q3. Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length.
-- Return the name and milliseconds for each track order by the song length with the longest
-- songs listed first.
    SELECT name, milliseconds
    FROM track
    WHERE milliseconds > (
    	SELECT AVG(milliseconds) as avg_track_len
    	FROM track)
    ORDER BY milliseconds DESC;

```

#### **Advanced Section**  
1. Determine which albums are the most profitable.  
2. Analyze the trend of monthly sales.  
3. Identify correlations between track lengths and popularity.

```sql
--Q1. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return
-- customer name, artist name and total spent.
    WITH best_selling_artist AS (
    	SELECT artist.artist_id as artist_id, artist.name as artist_name, SUM(invoice_line.unit_price*invoice_line.quantity) as amount_spent
    	FROM invoice_line
    	JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
    	JOIN album ON album.album_id = track.album_id
    	JOIN artist ON artist.artist_id = album.artist_id
    	GROUP BY 1
    	ORDER BY 3 DESC
    	LIMIT 1
    )
    SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, bsa.artist_name, SUM(il.unit_price*il.quantity) as Amount_spent
    FROM invoice i
    JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
    JOIN invoice_line il ON il.invoice_id = i.invoice_id
    JOIN track t ON t.track_id = il.track_id
    JOIN album alb ON alb.album_id = t.album_id
    JOIN best_selling_artist bsa ON bsa.artist_id = alb.artist_id
    GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
    ORDER BY 5 DESC;

--Q2. We want to find out the most popular music genre for each country. We determine the most pupolar
-- genre as the genre with highest amount of purchases. Write a query that returns each country along
-- with the top genre. For countries where the maximum number of purchases is shared return all genres.
    WITH popular_genre AS
    (
    	SELECT COUNT(invoice_line.quantity) as purchases, customer.country, genre.name, genre.genre_id,
    		ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer.country ORDER BY COUNT(invoice_line.quantity) DESC) as RowNo
    	FROM invoice_line
    		JOIN invoice ON invoice.invoice_id = invoice_line.invoice_id
    		JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
    		JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
    		JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
    		GROUP BY 2,3,4
    		ORDER BY 2 ASC, 1 DESC
    )
    SELECT * FROM popular_genre WHERE RowNo <=1;

--Q3. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country.
-- Write query that returns the country along with top customer and how much they spent.
-- For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount.
    WITH customer_with_country AS
    (
    	SELECT customer.customer_id, first_name, last_name, billing_country, SUM(total) as total_spending,
    	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY billing_country ORDER BY SUM(total) DESC) AS RowNo
    	FROM invoice
    	JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
    	GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
    	ORDER BY 4 ASC, 5 DESC
    )
    SELECT * FROM customer_with_country WHERE RowNo <=1;
